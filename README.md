# LeadClaw

**Stop losing jobs to forgotten follow-ups.**

LeadClaw is a lightweight lead tracking CLI for local service businesses. It tells you who to call today, drafts your follow-up texts, and keeps your pipeline visible — without a CRM subscription.

---

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/morgan-coded/leadclaw.git
cd leadclaw
pip install .
cp .env.example .env   # add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
leadclaw-seed          # init DB + load demo data
leadclaw digest        # first look at your pipeline
```

> AI features (`draft-followup`, `summarize`, `pipeline`) require an Anthropic API key.
> Get one free at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com).

## Schema

Leads live in SQLite. Statuses: `new` → `quoted` → `followup_due` → `won` / `lost`

`lost_reason` is structured (not free text):
`price` · `timing` · `went_competitor` · `no_response` · `not_qualified` · `service_area` · `other`
